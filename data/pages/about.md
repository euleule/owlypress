#About

**simbl** is a simple markdown based blog engine, that is written in JavaScript and uses a minimalistic PHP backend with the [Slimframework](http://slimframework.com/). The posts are renderen in JavaScript using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [PageDown](http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/). The default template obviously uses [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).


Posts and pages are created by uploading a markdown file to the posts or pages directory on your webserver.
