#This is a Blogpost
This is your first Blogpost. You can find it in the file */data/posts/firstpost.md* in the simbl directory on your webserver. To add a new post upload a markdown file to the */data/posts/* directory on your server. On the Home screen the last 10 posts are shown by default. The posts are ordered alphabetical, so you might want to use the date in the form yyyymmdd as filenames (e.g. 20121221.md for 21th Dec 2012). If you have more than one post per day, add more numbers or characters after the date. (e.g. 20121221a.md or 201212211.md or 20121221-my-post.md). If you want to remove a post, delete the posts-file from the webserver.
